            <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
            <p>In these chapters, Michael engages in a profound dialogue with Charlie about the importance of associations and lifelong learning. Here are the key takeaways:</p>

            <h3>Associations Matter</h3>
            <p>Charlie emphasizes that the people we associate with greatly influence our attitudes and outcomes in life. Michael is challenged to evaluate his current friendships and consider whether they uplift him or hold him back. He learns that successful people tend to surround themselves with others who inspire and challenge them.</p>

            <h3>Personal Development</h3>
            <p>The concept of self-improvement is central. To attract successful and positive people, one must first work on themselves. This involves seeking knowledge, adopting a growth mindset, and being open to new relationships that foster personal and professional growth.</p>

            <h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
            <p>Charlie highlights the difference between formal education and self-education, stressing that the latter is crucial for success. Reading books, learning from successful individuals, and reflecting on one’s experiences are essential practices. Michael realizes that he has neglected the value of reading and how it could enrich his life.</p>

            <h3>Practical Steps for Learning</h3>
            <p>Charlie outlines actionable steps for Michael to begin his journey of self-education. He suggests reading recommended books that can provide wisdom and new perspectives. The importance of setting goals, like committing to reading, is also emphasized.</p>

            <h3>Reflection and Application</h3>
            <p>Reading these chapters has prompted me to reflect on my own associations and commitment to learning. Here are some ways I can apply these insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaluate Relationships:</strong> I plan to take stock of my friendships and consider which ones are beneficial and which ones may be hindering my growth. I’ll focus on fostering connections with individuals who share my ambitions and values.</li>
                <li><strong>Commit to Lifelong Learning:</strong> I am inspired to read more and expand my knowledge base. I’ll set a goal to read one book from the list provided by Charlie, starting with "The Magic of Thinking Big." This will not only introduce me to new ideas but also help me grow personally and professionally.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek Out Mentorship:</strong> Just as Michael learns from Charlie, I’ll seek out mentors or individuals in my field whom I admire. I can learn from their experiences and insights, which could help accelerate my growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect Regularly:</strong> I’ll make it a habit to reflect on my experiences, both successes and failures. This will help me gain insights and adjust my approach as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Adopt a Growth Mindset:</strong> I will embrace challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than obstacles. This mindset shift will help me remain open to new experiences and relationships that can enhance my life.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By implementing these strategies, I hope to foster a positive environment around me and cultivate a mindset geared toward continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>Currently working towards my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, I have acquired problem solving skill, coding skills and a good sense of cordination.</p>
